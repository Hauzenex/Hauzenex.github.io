        <div style="position:relative; left:0px; top:-400px;"><p>Hello nerd this is hauzenex and if you havent already seen it yeah the look of this website changed alot mostly from july that i still got that website saved on the Wayback Machine and right now this font is comic sans and comic sans is like just pretty much huted everywhere at every second everytime im probably gonna change this font to something else something better but i wont change this text cause typing too much is kinda hard yeah so im trying to become a coder atleast for now a simple one im watching html and css tutorials some small course but at the moment that im writing this im thinking of watching that one 6 hours video of html and other long one of css im still a very very beginner i can pratically code nothing all this code css is from the html and css course except that this top part is red i got it from forship fireship i think thats his name so yeah im still very trash at it dont hope for too much i wanted to make so much cool things i wanted t o put a background music a calm one and i also wanted to when you hover over the name Hauzenex this red changed to some animation and the text changed too the text would turn like into a background the text itself would be te background like if i set the text color to green and used a green screen to put a landscape background on it but that would require me to change from text to a png or gif file that had teh exact same shape of teh text and as technically the text doesnt has quality its like a vector it would have to be a well-fitting vector i kinda know how vectors work cause as alot of people i kinda know how to code in scratch very basic and its primarly svg which is vector also talking about scratch wait imma check something and btw today is 23/01/2023 21:37 9:37PM so i just checked and it said that my scratch account was created 2 years and 3 months ago even though i probably didnt use it for probably 1 year 6 months or something i used to use it more hwen i created it and yeah my scratch account is z9k87 think of like these people who have a nickname all across the internet like think of a nickname like bob then his facebook account name is bob his instagram name is bob youtube google everywhere so at that time for me it was z9k87 idk why it was just random letters but now i dont have that anymore i mean its kinda of anooba which was a internal joke from my friends from bonk.io that i know since 2018 cause my name was anubis then they always called me noob and then they started thinking anubis + noob = anooba so iguess now im a noob a anoob would also just work so yeah at this exact time im just waiting cause im gonna sleep and i guess i go back to writing tomorrow bye cutie reader</p></div>
