my name is caio and some people call me smart<br>
or genius talented and that i have a bright brain...<br>
or just bright... like the sun<br>
the sun is a star in the center of our solar system which is on the milky way<br>
it was believed that 1.3 million earths could fit inside our solar system sun<br>

this is what would be the math about how many earths would fit in the sun<br>
its simply getting the sun volume and dividing it by the earth volume<br>
but if you think just a little bit you know that spheres are not like cubes<br>
    or others shapes, spheres dont fit in each other</p>

<p align="center" >just like that, as you can see the round shapes the spheres let some gaps<br>
so calculating every gap that it would make in a 3D space<br>
    it would would fit 932.884 earths inside the sun </p>
